# Boston-Housing
 
This is a multiple linear regression of housing prices in the Boston suburbs using both Stats Models as well as SKlearn. This was derived from a tutorial provided by Adi Bronshtein of General Assembly - https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-and-multiple-linear-regression-in-python-c928425168f9.

Written evaluation of the model is mine.
